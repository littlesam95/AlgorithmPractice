### 문제 설명

<p>Taking attendance in your class is a tedious task. You call out the names of students one at a time in alphabetical order. If the student is present, they respond by saying "<code>Present!</code>" before you call the next name.</p>

<p>This is such a boring task that you sometimes zone out and don't keep a proper record of attendance. Write a program to help you summarize the absences!</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of input contains a single integer $N$ $(1 \leq N \leq 200)$ indicating the number of "callouts". Then $N$ lines follow indicating the callouts that were made in the order they were made. A single line consists of either a student's name or of the response <code>Present!</code>. A student's name will consist of between $2$ and $10$ characters, the first always being an uppercase letter (<code>'A'</code>-<code>'Z'</code>) and the remaining characters always being lowercase letters (<code>'a'</code>-<code>'z'</code>).</p>

<p>The student names will appear in alphabetical order in this input and a line with the response <code>Present!</code> will only appear if the previous line was the name of a student. In particular, the response <code>Present!</code> will never appear as the first callout.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Output the names of all students that are absent in the order they were called, each on a separate line. If no students were absent, simply output the message <code>No Absences</code></p>
